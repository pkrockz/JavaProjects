## Code Style Guidelines

### Java Conventions

- **Naming:**
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `CombatSims3`)
  - Methods: `camelCase` (e.g., `setUnitStats`)
  - Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `unitName`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_HP`)

- **Formatting:**
  - Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
  - Place opening braces on the same line
  - Add spaces around operators
  - Keep lines under 120 characters when possible

- **Comments:**
  - Add comments for complex logic
  - Use JavaDoc for public methods and classes
  - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Example
```java
/**
 * Sets the statistics for a unit.
 * @param name The name of the unit
 * @param attack The attack value
 */
public void setUnitStats(String name, int attack) {
    this.unitName = name;
    this.unitAttack = attack;
}
```

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### CombatSims
- Maintain compatibility with existing unit stat systems
- Ensure all unit types have balanced stats
- Test combat simulations thoroughly
- Document any new unit types or mechanics

### GuardianPass 2.0
- Prioritize user security and privacy
- Clearly document any encryption changes
- Test GUI changes on multiple platforms
- Maintain backward compatibility with stored passwords

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Compile and Test**
   ```bash
   javac YourFile.java
   java YourClass
   ```

2. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Invalid inputs
   - Boundary values
   - Unusual scenarios

3. **Test on Your Platform**
   - Ensure code runs on your Java version
   - Test GUI applications visually
   - Verify file I/O operations
